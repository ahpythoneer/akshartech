# Pushing Your AksharTech Project to GitHub

I've created a script to help you push your entire project to GitHub. Here's how to use it:

## Step 1: Make Sure Your GitHub Repository Exists

Before running the script, ensure you've created the repository on GitHub:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Set the repository name to "akshartech"
3. Leave all initialization options unchecked (no README, no .gitignore, no license)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run:

```bash
# For Windows PowerShell (if running from PowerShell)
chmod +x push-full-project.sh

# If chmod doesn't work on Windows, you can try
# running the script directly with bash:
# bash push-full-project.sh
```

## Step 3: Run the Script

```bash
# For Windows with Git Bash installed
./push-full-project.sh

# Alternatively
bash push-full-project.sh
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Repository

After the script completes successfully:

1. Visit https://github.com/ahpythoneer/akshartech
2. You should see all your project files there

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

### Authentication Issues

If you're prompted for authentication:
- Enter your GitHub username
- For the password, use a personal access token (not your GitHub password)
- To create a personal access token, visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### Permission Denied

If you get "Permission denied" errors, make sure:
- Your GitHub account has proper permissions
- You're using the correct authentication method
- You've created the repository on GitHub

### Other Issues

If you encounter other issues, you can:
1. Try using GitHub Desktop (see github-desktop-guide.md)
2. Try uploading files directly through the GitHub website

## Next Steps After Successful Push

Once your code is on GitHub:

1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (already configured in your .github/workflows directory)
2. Deploy your application using Docker and the provided docker-compose.yml
3. Configure your domain (akshartech.us) with Cloudflare as mentioned in your requirements
