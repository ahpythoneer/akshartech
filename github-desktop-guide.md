# Using GitHub Desktop to Push Your Project to GitHub

GitHub Desktop provides a user-friendly graphical interface for Git operations. This is an excellent alternative if you're having trouble with Git command line.

## Step 1: Download and Install GitHub Desktop

1. Visit the official GitHub Desktop website: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Click the "Download for Windows" button.
3. Once downloaded, run the installer (GitHubDesktopSetup.exe).
4. The installer will guide you through the setup process.
5. When prompted, sign in to your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Add Your Local Repository

1. Open GitHub Desktop after installation.
2. Click on "File" > "Add local repository..."
3. Browse to your project folder: `e:/AksharTech`
4. Click "Select Folder"

   Note: If the folder is not already a Git repository, GitHub Desktop will ask if you want to create a repository here. Click "Create a repository" when prompted.

## Step 3: Create the Repository

If prompted to create a repository:

1. Fill in the repository details:
   - Name: "akshartech"
   - Description: "AksharTech website with React frontend and Flask backend"
   - Local path: should already be set to `e:/AksharTech`
   - Check "Initialize this repository with a README" if you want an additional README
   - Keep Git ignore set to "Windows" (or you can select None since we've already created a .gitignore file)
   - Choose a license if desired

2. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Make Your Initial Commit

1. You'll see all the files in your project listed in the Changes panel.
2. Ensure all files are checked (or uncheck any files you don't want to commit).
3. Add a summary for your commit (e.g., "Initial commit: AksharTech website").
4. Optionally, add a more detailed description.
5. Click "Commit to master" (or "Commit to main" depending on your default branch name).

## Step 5: Publish Your Repository to GitHub

1. After committing, click the "Publish repository" button at the top.
2. In the dialog that appears:
   - Ensure the name is set to "akshartech"
   - Add a description if needed
   - Choose whether to keep the repository private or make it public
   - Uncheck "Keep this code private" if you want a public repository

3. Click "Publish repository"

## Step 6: Verify Your Repository on GitHub

1. After publishing, GitHub Desktop will show a "View on GitHub" button.
2. Click it to open your repository in your web browser.
3. Verify that all your files have been uploaded correctly.

## Making Future Changes

To make future updates to your repository:

1. Make changes to your files locally.
2. Open GitHub Desktop.
3. Review the changes in the Changes panel.
4. Add a commit summary and description.
5. Click "Commit to master/main".
6. Click "Push origin" to upload your changes to GitHub.

## Setting Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to host your frontend on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on "Settings".
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy (usually "main" or "master").
5. Choose the folder containing your built frontend (usually "/docs" or "/build").
6. Click "Save".

Your site will be published to `https://ahpythoneer.github.io/akshartech/`.

## Note on Docker and GitHub Actions

The Docker and GitHub Actions configurations you've created will work once the code is on GitHub, provided the environment where they run has Docker and Git installed.
